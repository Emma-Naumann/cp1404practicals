### 3 Main Principles of "Clean Code"

- DRY: don't repeat yourself (use functions for sections of code which are repeated multiple times)
- SRP: single responsibility principle (a function should do just one thing)
- Naming: naming should always follow PEP8 standards (this is strongly recommended for "clean code")
